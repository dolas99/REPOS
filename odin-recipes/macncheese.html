    <h2>About this Macaroni and Cheese</h2>
    <p>This is a Mac and Cheese recipe that is everything you want in a 'knock your socks' off Macaroni Cheese. It's cheesy and creamy, 
        with perfectly cooked macaroni, plenty of sauce and a crunchy buttery top.</p>
<h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup gruyere cheese, shredded</li>
  <li>1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
  <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
  <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
  <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp mustard poowder</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>3 cups whole milk</li>
  <li>3 tbsp flour</li>
  <li>3 tbsp butter (melted)</li>
  <li> 250g macaroni</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Steps</strong></h4>

<ol>
    <li>Cook the pasta. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.
Cook the macaroni until just al dente (slightly undercooked, as it will bake later).
Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Make the roux (base for cheese sauce). In a saucepan, melt 3 tbsp butter over medium heat.
         Stir in flour and cook for 1–2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.</li>
    <li> Build the cheese sauce. Gradually whisk in milk, stirring constantly until smooth and thickened.
        Season with garlic powder, onion powder, mustard powder, salt, and pepper.
        Stir in Gruyere and mozzarella, reserving a handful of each for topping.
        Mix until melted into a creamy sauce.</li>
    <li> Combine pasta and sauce. Add drained macaroni to the sauce. Stir well to coat.
        Pour into a buttered baking dish.</li>
    <li>Make the crunchy topping. Mix panko breadcrumbs with 1 tbsp melted butter and the reserved cheese.
        Sprinkle evenly over the top.</li>
    <li>Bake at 190°C (375°F) for 20–25 minutes, until golden and bubbling.</li>
</ol>
